***Yokozuna*** is the highest rank in sumo.

To date just 72 men have attained the status since it was first created in the
late 1700s.
Yokozuna can never be demoted. They are seen as the living embodiment of sumo, and
when no longer able to uphold the standards of the rank, they are expected to retire.
